In this case, the subject is \"It\".\n2) Next, let's analyze the verb in the sentence, which is \"would be\". This is an auxiliary verb that indicates a past tense.\n3) Now, let's look at the object of the verb, which is \"it would have been\". This suggests that something was done in the past and we are talking about its consequences.\n4) The adjective \"last year\" tells us when the action took place, but it does not necessarily indicate a specific time period.\n5) Finally, the phrase \"but not a year ago\" adds more information to the timeline of the event. It means that while something happened last year, it was not exactly one year ago.\nPutting all these pieces together, we can determine that the overall emotional tone of the sentence is most likely regretful or disappointed, but with some uncertainty due to the phrase \"but not a year ago\". \nFinal Emotion: Regretful and uncertain.\n", "gold_label": "disapproval"}

The phrase \"will start falling eventually\" indicates a potential decline in their performance or progress.\n6. Therefore, the emotion expressed by [NAME] is likely to be disappointment or frustration due to their inability to improve in shooting despite doing well in other aspects.\n7.

{"text": "Cause emotions are difficult and people fear rejection", "emotion": "fear", "cot": " \nLet's go through this step by step to analyze the emotional content of the text.\n1) The first part of the sentence states that \"cause\" is followed by an idea, which is then followed by two verbs, \"emotions\" and \"people\". These words indicate that the sentence is talking about a cause-and-effect relationship between something happening (the cause) and its effects (emotions).\n2) The first verb, \"are difficult\", indicates that emotions are challenging to handle. This means that it may be hard for people to deal with their feelings.\n3) The second part of the sentence continues by stating that \"people fear rejection\". This implies that individuals are afraid of being rejected or excluded from a group or community. This can be a significant source of anxiety and distress for many people, as it involves vulnerability and potential social consequences.\n4) Combining all these points, we can conclude that the overall emotional content of the text is one of difficulty and fear. It suggests that emotions are challenging to manage, and individuals may experience feelings of apprehension or worry about being rejected by others. \nFinal Emotion: Fear/Anxiety\n", "gold_label": "fear"}

It seems like the speaker has a positive opinion about Nirvana as a band, but they also mention that there is a group of people in their fan base who are not very good or skilled. \n\nNext, let's analyze the emotion expressed by the speaker towards this group of people. They use words like \"awful\" and \"underratedly awful\", which indicates a negative emotion towards them. However, they also mention that there are some fans in their fan base who are great at playing their instruments, suggesting that not everyone is bad or lacks skill. \n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the final emotion expressed by the speaker towards this group of people is likely frustration or disappointment. They may feel frustrated with those who are underperforming compared to others in their fan base, but also disappointed that some fans are unable to play as well as they could.

Additionally, the use of \"dude\" and \"waiting for that to happen to me\" indicate a possible sense of eagerness or enthusiasm.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the context in which these indicators are used. \nThe text mentions someone offering a hit of weed, indicating a potential positive experience associated with this offer. The mention of waiting suggests anticipation and excitement, further supporting the presence of positive emotions.\n\nStep 3: Consider any potential conflicting emotions or concerns. \nHowever, the use of the word \"offered\" may also indicate a sense of uncertainty or hesitation on the part of the speaker. The phrase \"dude\" can be interpreted as either endearing or dismissive, which could create some ambiguity in terms of the speaker's true feelings.\n\nStep 4: Weigh the indicators against one another and consider any overall sentiment. \nBased on the positive indicators of anticipation and excitement, it appears that the speaker is primarily experiencing a sense of enthusiasm for the potential experience described in the text. However, there may also be some underlying uncertainty or hesitancy due to the conflicting nature of the phrase \"dude.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine my final emotion based on the analysis. \nAfter considering all the indicators and weighing them against one another, it is likely that the speaker's final emotion is a combination of excitement and uncertainty. The anticipation for a potential positive experience may be balanced by some hesitation or doubt, resulting in a complex emotional state.

These words have opposite meanings and are used in close proximity, which suggests a contrast or contradiction between them. This could indicate confusion or frustration with the situation.\n\nNext, let's look at the context of the text. The phrase \"weed\" typically refers to marijuana, while the word \"vaccination rates\" is a term used to describe the percentage of people who receive certain vaccinations. These two words are not directly related and may seem out of place together. This could further contribute to the confusion or frustration expressed by the user.\n\nNow, we can also see that the user uses sarcasm in their statement by saying \"terrible vaccination rates\". This suggests that the user actually believes the opposite - that high vaccination rates are desirable. The use of irony and contradiction adds another layer to the emotional content of the text.\n\nBased on these observations, we can infer that the overall emotion expressed in this text is a combination of confusion and sarcasm.

They feel that their autonomy and independence are being challenged by the other person.\n\nNext, let's consider the use of language in this statement. The phrase \"You're not my dad\" implies a comparison between the speaker and their adoptive father, which could potentially cause hurt or resentment towards the other person for not having a biological connection with them. This further adds to the emotional intensity of the statement.\n\nFinally, let's consider the context of the text as a whole.

The article about machinery innovation provides more neutral sentiments than that of crop yield improvement but is more negative than the one on pest control.\n3. The most positive article discusses crop yield improvement, while the least positive one talks about genetic modification.\n4. Neither of the articles from source B or E discuss water management.\n5.

This also means that, since article C is less positive than the one from source D, C must be about machinery innovation. \n\nSince C reports a more positive sentiment than Article E but is less positive than that of Article B, it's clear that A provides neutral sentiments, B talks about genetic modification and E discusses crop yield improvement. This means that the article on water management provided by source D also gives negative sentiments.\n\nAnswer: \nArticle A - Neutral Sentiment, Source C,\nArticle B - Negative sentiment, Source E,\nArticle C - Positive sentiment, Source B,\nArticle D - Negative sentiment, Source D,\nArticle E - Positive sentiment, Source A.\n", "gold_label": "curiosity"}

{"text": "I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk.", "emotion": "", "cot": " \n1. The user is expressing a preference for dating non-smokers. This shows that the user values their partner's health and well-being.\n2. The use of the words \"don't\" and \"as for\" indicates a strong stance on this issue, implying that the user has clear and definite opinions.\n3. The mention of recreational drug users being unattractive reflects the user's aversion towards substance abuse. This could suggest that the user values stability and sobriety in their relationships.\n4. Overall, the text presents the user as a person with strong personal values and standards for themselves and others. They prioritize health and clean living, which may also extend to other aspects of life such as family and work. \n5.

{"text": "Oh my [NAME] I just noticed this too! I just rewatched it recently and noticed him just drinking some tea next to [NAME] and [NAME].", "emotion": "", "cot": " \nTo determine the final emotion, we need to go through a series of steps. First, let's identify what the user is watching on Netflix. The text says \"Oh my [name] I just noticed this too! I just rewatched it recently and noticed him just drinking some tea next to [name].\" This means that the user is watching a movie or show where someone is drinking tea.\n\nNext, we need to look at who the person drinking tea is. The text says \"next to [NAME]\" which is most likely one of the other characters in the movie or show. So, this character is currently drinking tea next to another character.\n\nThe user also mentions that they just rewatched the scene recently. This means that they have a connection to this particular moment in the story and are paying attention to it. We can infer from this that the user is probably feeling some kind of emotion towards one of the characters who is drinking tea.\n\nSince there are no other emotions mentioned in the text, we can assume that the user's current emotion is likely to be a combination of surprise and curiosity. They have just noticed something that they didn't realize before (the character drinking tea) and now they are curious about why this happens. This could also mean that the user is intrigued by the dynamics between these two characters.\n", "gold_label": "surprise"}

Look for keywords or phrases that indicate a strong emotion, such as \"seems pretty decent\", \"side-eyeing the hell out of him\" and \"bizarre and creepy\".

Based on these observations, it seems that the speaker's final emotion is positive and strong - they are happy with their partner despite some negative experiences at the restaurant.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the final emotion in this text is \"positive\".\n5. Final Emotion: Positive.\n", "gold_label": "admiration"}
